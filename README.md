This is the code for my project 'Quality of Magic: the Gathering Cards for Draft' [located here](https://grantq9.github.io/MTG-Draft-Card-Quality/). I built a model to determine the win rate of Magic the Gathering cards based off their rarity and mana cost, using data from cards in the last 2 years of Standard-legal Magic sets. Additionally, I looked at the most recent set of Magic, Bloomburrow, and examined how accurately the model predicted the average winrates.
