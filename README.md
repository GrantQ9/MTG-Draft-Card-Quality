This is the code for my project 'Quality of Magic: the Gathering Cards for Draft' [located here](https://grantq9.github.io/MTG-Draft-Card-Quality/). I built a model to determine the win rate of Magic the Gathering cards based off their rarity and mana cost, using data from cards in the last 2 years of Standard-legal Magic sets. Additionally, I built a model specifically for creature cards, incorporating aspects like their power and toughness, and used this model as well as the original to predict how good cards in the newest Magic set Bloomburrow would be.
