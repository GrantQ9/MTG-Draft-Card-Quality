I'm Grant Quattlebaum, I'm an aspiring computer scientist, my Github profile is [GrantQ9](https://github.com/GrantQ9) and my email address is <grantq9@gmail.com>.

This project is about building models to see how certain card traits of Magic: the Gathering cards impact their usefulness in draft. For access to all the data and code used in the project, see the Github page  [here](https://github.com/GrantQ9/MTG-Draft-Card-Quality).

This project was done as part of my time in [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
